## **Status**
This software is currently not actively maintained. At present only the forward-folder method is included. 
Gold and Bayes unfolders to be included.

## **Installation**  

### **Prerequisites**
Install the project mandatory dependencies:  
* ROOT [https://root.cern.ch/]

Make sure you have set the following environment variables to the external library installation dirs 
* ROOTSYS: set to ROOT installation prefix

NB: Modify Makefile CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS in case the dependency tools cannot be found.

### **Build**
To build the project:

* Clone this repository into your local $SOURCE_DIR    
  ```git clone https://github.com/PierreAugerObservatory/CRSourceFitter.git $SOURCE_DIR```    
* In the project directory type:    
  ```make```  

Binaries will be placed in the bin/ directory and libraries in the lib/ directory.

### **Usage**
* ```SpectrumUnfolder --input=[path-to-inputfile] [--histoname=[data-histo-name]]```       
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```--input -  Input file name containing histogram to be read (.root)```     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```--histoname - Name of histogram with spectrum data to be unfolded (default=RecSpectrum)```
